## Welcome to QuiViRR on GitHub

This is a complementary living archive/space to the QuiViRR journal website.

### What content can you find here?

On GitHub, you will find content that is version controlled and has pre- and/or post-publication comments or peer review. The official publication (versions) always resides on the OJS website, whereas the versionable content is placed on GitHub in a public repository.

### How do you create an issue for an article and comment on issue?

If you have a GitHub account, you can create an issue in GitHub using the new issue button. Give as much information in your issue as possible to help the author(s) and editors. Only the author(s) and editors can assign labels, assignees, project boards, milestones.

Issues will be placed on the project board for the article in question. This is a kanban board that makes visible a workflow from To Do, In Focus, In Progress, to Done. Only the author(s) and editors can move issues on the board.

You can comment on an issue that has already been created. Comments are listed in order of ascending date.

### How to make a pull request for suggesting changes to an article?

If you wish to suggest an explicit change to the text of an article (in markdown, for example), then you can click on the edit pencil for a specific file, and GitHub will guide you through the process to make an instant pull request.

You can also fork the article's repository to your own account, make a change, commit and then make a pull request to the original repository.
