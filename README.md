## Welcome to QuiViRR on GitHub

This is a living archive/workspace complementary to the [QuiViRR journal website](https://journals.aau.dk/index.php/QUIVIRR).

### What content can you find here?

On QuiViRR@GitHub, you will find a smaller selection of articles that are submitted to QuiViRR for review as well as some published articles.
Articles may have pre- and/or post-publication comments or be under peer review.
The changes to article content are natively tracked using what is called 'version control'.
The official publication (and its versions) always resides on the OJS website, whereas if there is tracked content, then it is also placed on GitHub in its own public repository.
A [list of article repositories](articles.md) is available.

### How do you create an issue for an article and comment on an existing issue?

If you have a GitHub account, you can create an `Issue` in GitHub using the `New issue` button (under `Issues`).
Give as much information when you write your issue as possible to help the author(s) and editors.
Note that only the author(s) and editors can assign labels, assignees, project boards and milestones.

Issues will be placed on the `Project board` for the article in question (under `Projects`).
This takes the form of what is called a 'kanban board' that makes visible to everyone the current work-in-progress under the headings *To Do*, *In Focus*, *In Progress*, and *Done*.
Note, however, that only the author(s) and editors can move 'issues' from one column to another on the Project board.

You can comment on an issue that has already been created, including your own.
Comments are listed in order of ascending date.

### How to make a `pull request` for suggesting changes to an article?

If you wish to suggest an explicit change to the text of an article (in `Markdown` style, for example), then you can click on the edit pencil for the specific file, and GitHub will guide you through the process to make an instant `Pull request`.

You can also `Fork` the article's repository to your own account, make a change, commit and then make a `Pull request` to the original repository.
This requires more familiarity with GitHub and the `Pull request` workflow.

### How can I view previous releases (versions) of an article?

All official versions of a published article hosted on GitHub will be archived on the QuiViRR journal website.
Note that the GitHub repository for the article may have more frequent `Releases` than versions on the journal website.
Releases and tags are listed in reverse chronological order (under `Releases`).

### How can I view earlier changes to the article in a precise manner?

If you look at the `Commit` history for an article hosted on GitHub, then you can easily view early revisions that the author(s) and/or editor have made.
Simply click on the commit that interests you and the precise line changes become visible in colour, as what is called a `Diff`.
Alternatively, the `history of revisions` let's you browse all the files of the selected `Commit`.

If you view a selected file, then you will be able to see a more detailed history of that file with `Blame`.
This allows you to navigate earlier changes made to the file using `Diff`.
