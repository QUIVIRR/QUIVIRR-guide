## Welcome to QuiViRR on GitHub

This is a living archive/workspace complementary to the QuiViRR journal website.

### What content can you find here?

On QuiViRR@GitHub, you will find content that is version controlled and has pre- and/or post-publication comments or peer review. The official publication (and release versions) always resides on the OJS website, whereas if there is versionable content, then it is placed on GitHub in its own public repository. A [list of article repositories](articles.md) is available.

### How do you create an issue for an article and comment on an issue?

If you have a GitHub account, you can create an `Issue` in GitHub using the `New issue` button (under `Issues`). Give as much information in your issue as possible to help the author(s) and editors. Note that only the author(s) and editors can assign labels, assignees, project boards and milestones.

Issues will be placed on the `Project board` for the article in question (under `Projects`). This is a kanban board that makes visible a workflow from *To Do*, *In Focus*, *In Progress*, to *Done*. Only the author(s) and editors can move issues on the board.

You can comment on an issue that has already been created. Comments are listed in order of ascending date.

### How to make a pull request for suggesting changes to an article?

If you wish to suggest an explicit change to the text of an article (in `Markdown`, for example), then you can click on the edit pencil for a specific file, and GitHub will guide you through the process to make an instant `Pull request`.

You can also `Fork` the article's repository to your own account, make a change, commit and then make a `Pull request` to the original repository. This requires more familiarity with GitHub and the `Pull request` workflow.

### How can I see previous releases (versions) of an article?

All official versions of an article hosted on GitHub will be archived on the QuiViRR journal website. The GitHub repository for the article archives may have more smaller `Releases`. Releases and tags are listed in reverse chronological order (under `Releases`).

### How can I see earlier changes to the article in a precise manner?

If you look at the `Commit` history for an article hosted on GitHub, then you can easily peek at early revisions that the author(s) and/or editor have made. Just click on the commit that interests you and the precise line changes are shown in colour as a `Diff`. Alternatively, you can browse all the files at the time of this particular `Commit` in the history of revisions.

If you look at a particular file, then you can see more history of that file only with `Blame`. This allows you to navigate earlier changes to the file using `Diff`.
